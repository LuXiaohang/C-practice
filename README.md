Homework 1:
	Achieve Fraction Class:
	a) Make the initialization (constructor) more reasonable, including but not limited to: no parameter constructor, Integer parameter constructor, single real number constructor, two-parameter constructor, and consider why so many constructors are needed;
	b) Achieve the realization of fractional class as far as possible, at least to achieve ++, +, -, [], =, ==, <and other operators;
	c) Realize a sort function. It must be able to meet a variety of data types, including the fraction class;
	d) Think about how the sort function can be better shared, how to rewrite the traditional sort function [sort (int arr, int n), where n is the number of array members] to meet the need to meet the needs;
