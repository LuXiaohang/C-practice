Homework 1:  
	Achieve Fraction Class:  
	a) Make the initialization (constructor) more reasonable, including but not limited to: no parameter constructor, Integer parameter constructor, single real number constructor, two-parameter constructor, and consider why so many constructors are needed;  
	b) Achieve the realization of fractional class as far as possible, at least to achieve ++, +, -, [], =, ==, <and other operators;  
	c) Realize a sort function. It must be able to meet a variety of data types, including the fraction class;  
	d) Think about how the sort function can be better shared, how to rewrite the traditional sort function [sort (int arr, int n), where n is the number of array members] to meet the need to meet the needs;  
  
Homework 2:
	 Achieve Vector:
	 a) Data must be organized in an equal-length multi-block mode to support basic data management functions, including additions and deletions at any location;  
	 b) Prevent the header files from being loaded multiple times;  
	 c) Note the use of pointers, constructors, copy constructors, and destructors, especially the proper release of the new allocated memory space in the destructor;  
	 d) Note the use of const, &;  
	 e) Implementation of the iterator, not including const series iterator, supporting begin (), end (), rbegin (), rend () and other functions; supporting ++, -,! = Operator overload;  
	 f) Support the following functions on the capacity: size (), resize (), capacity (), empty () and so on;  
	 g) Support the following data read function: [], back (), at (), front ();  
	 h) Supports the following data modification functions: assign (), push_back (), pop_back (), insert (), erase (), swap (), clear ().
